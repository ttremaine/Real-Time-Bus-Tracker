# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker Project

## Description
This exercise used mapbox to display a map and bus tracker on the page. Using MBTA bus data, I located the bus stops between Harvard and MIT. An animated marker on the map highlights the bus route following those stops.

## How to Run
You can open the game at the following link: 
To run the game on your machine, download the files via the green Code button in the GitHub repository and open on your local browser.

## Future Improvements
Next, I want to work on updating the map so that specific stops are marked. I would also like to add more routes.
